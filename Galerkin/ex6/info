#To compile the code due the following in a  terminal/Konsole/shell
# use cd to enter the main folder of the program



# first of all create the function spaces and forms by using the 
# ffc compiler of fenics by typing

ffc -l dolfin -O ex6_sys.ufl

# this creates a file ex6_sys.h that contains the description of 
# finite elements and forms for the Poisson problem.
# whenever you change the file ex6_sys.ufl you have to rerun ffc



#next create the makefile that tells the compiler how to build the programm.

# enter the directory make
# in this directory the information is found how the program is built out of the
# source files

#type (note the '.' at the end):
cmake .

# this will generate a bunch of files, where the Makefile is the most important for us.
# after the Makefile is created you do not need to type this again (also not after you changed the *.ufl file)
 
# to compile the programm type:
make 

# this will create the program (e.g. ex2 if you did not change the 
# variable PROJECT_NAME in ProjectSpecificData)

# you can run the code by typing
./ex6



# You have to change parts of the *.cpp file as marked in this file.

# A note to users of Eclipse:
# under properties->C/C++ build  of your project you find the points
# 'Makefile generation' and 'build location'
# uncheck the box 'Generate Makefile automatically'
# and state the path to the Makefile generated with cmake under 'Build Directory'
# now you can compile the code using Eclipse

#it is recommended to use Eclipse
