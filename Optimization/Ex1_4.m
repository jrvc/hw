% MINIMAL TRIANGULATED GRAPHS
% Compute the minimal triangular graph over Omega := (0,1)x(0,1).
%
% Find q : Ã–mega -> R, s.t.  
%         a) q is picewise linear and continuos in a linear triangulation of Omega
%         b) q has the minimal surface graph among all picewise functionals
%         c) q satisfies the boundary conditions:
%               q(x1,x2) = 1/2 - |x2 - 1/2| for (x1,x2) in the boundary
